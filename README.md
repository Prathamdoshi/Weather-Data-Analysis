# Weather-Data-Analysis

## Intoduction & Purpose
The purpose of this project was to further master skills in `API Calls` and transforming the data into analyzable and insightful format. For this project, 500 random cities were generated and their weather data was collected using `openweathermapy`. This project also used `citipy` module to find the nearest cities based on the random combination of latitude and longitude generated.

## Objective
This project's objective as to find relation between `Latitude` and different weather data variables such as `Temprature, Cloudiness, Wind Speed`. By latitude, the data had the equator line as the point of reference. Overall, trying to measure the effect of equator on factos such as `Temprature, Cloudiness, Wind Speed`.
